Description: The "sqrootlasso" function is to estimate the regression coefficient by using square-root lasso in high-dimensional linear regression model,
      and the "avermiss" function is to measure the performance off lasso by calculating the average number of regressors missed from the true model,the average number of regressors selected outside the model and relative average empirical risk.
